# Object Detection with YOLOv8 using Ultralytics Library

This repository contains code for performing object detection tasks using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm with the Ultralytics library.

## Description

The provided code performs object detection using a YOLO model initialized with pre-trained weights. It also includes a demonstration of training the YOLO model with a specified dataset. Additionally, the code performs object detection on a set of test images and visualizes the detection results.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Ultralytics library (`!pip install ultralytics`)
- PyTorch
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   !pip install ultralytics
   ```

2. Run the code in a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or any Python script editor.

3. The code will initialize the YOLO model, perform training (if applicable), and then perform object detection on the specified test images.

## File Descriptions

- `object_detection.py`: Python script containing the code for object detection tasks.
- `data.yaml`: YAML file containing information about the dataset used for training the YOLO model.
